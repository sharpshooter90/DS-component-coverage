## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Plugin won't load

**Solution**:

- Ensure `npm run build` completed successfully
- Check that `code.js` and `dist/index.html` exist
- Try re-importing the plugin
- Restart Figma Desktop App

### Issue: Build errors

**Solution**:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: UI doesn't update

**Solution**:

- Close plugin in Figma
- Run `npm run build` again
- Reopen plugin

### Issue: TypeScript errors

**Solution**:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors

**Solution**:

- Ensure all dependencies installed: `npm install`

## üîÑ Development Mode Testing

### Using Watch Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both plugin and UI in watch mode.

**Testing Flow**:

1. Start watch mode: `npm run dev`
2. Make code changes
3. In Figma, close and reopen plugin to see changes
4. Repeat

**Tips**:

- UI changes require plugin restart in Figma
- Plugin code changes also require restart
- Watch mode auto-rebuilds on save

## üìä Performance Testing

- [ ] No browser crashes
- [ ] Results are accurate

### Deeply Nested Test

- [ ] Create deeply nested structure (10+ levels)
- [ ] Run analysis
- [ ] All layers analyzed
- [ ] Paths shown correctly in detailed view
